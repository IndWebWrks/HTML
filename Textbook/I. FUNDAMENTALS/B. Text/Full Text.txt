TEXT
xxxxx
So we know the web is essentially the passing of marked up plain text from host 
to client.  Before we begin marking up text, let us pause a moment and ask, how 
does a browser treat text independent of markup?  Can I expect a plain text 
document, free of markup to look the same in a browser as a file we may create?

We will first focus on the text of a web page.  We will start by exmaining the 
flow of text regardless of medium or writing system.  From there we will narrow 
our scope to the Latin-based writing system, more specifically English.  We will 
then create web page absent of any html markup and examine how a browser 
displays it.  We will conclude with an examination of character codes, what 
they are and how and when to use them.


TEXT FLOW
=========

Text is the product of a writing system.  Writing systems have been in use for 
thousands of years, resulting in close to four thousand different systems.  A 
writing system consists of a collection of symbols, characters, glyphs, or 
whatever you choose to call them.  The writing system assigns meaning to these 
characters.

In the English writing system characters (letters), or combination 
of charaters are assigned a particular sound made by the mouth when speaking.  
Putting a sequence of letters together text can mimick a spoken word.  Words 
are separated by a space allowing a sequence of text to create a spoken phrase. 
English's collection includes punctuation characters too.

In the Chinese writing system a character is assigned to a common word or 
simple concept.  These simpler one character words are combined based on their 
meanings into two, three, and far less common four charater groups to form new
word representations.  Chinese writing system does not use spaces between words
nor does it have any punctuation characters.

Along with a collection of characters, a writing system has rules on the proper 
use it. Such as which corner of a page do you begin reading or writing text.  
As mentioned, text is a sequence of characters of after another, which 
direction does this flow of text go?  Left or right?  Up or down?  English goes 
left to right.  Arabic is written right to left.  Chinese is top to bottom, but 
is also written left to right.  We will refer the choice of what direction text 
flows to as the inline progression rule.

As text flows in the system determined direction it will inevitably run into 
the opposite side of the page.  Writing systems govern how to start a new 
sequence of characters.  In left to right and right to left systems the next 
line of text is created below the previous line, but returning to the same side 
of the page to start and proceed in the same direction as the line above it.  In 
top to bottom writing systems the next line of text to the left of the previous 
line, but returning to the top of the page to start and proceeding in the same 
direction as the line to the right of it.  This particular flow of text is 
commonly referred to as word wrapping, but we will refer to it as the block 
progression rule.

As a segway to continue our discussion, let's focus on the page.  A page has a 
width and a height; consequently, a page has an area (area = height * width).  
Assume the page is full of text.  Let us view the text as a block.  A block 
with width, height, and area.

  .-----------------.	
  |                |_\	
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |	
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |	A block text
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |
  |  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  |
  |                  |
  '------------------'


INLINE PROGRESSION
------------------
We discussed inline progression prior, it's the starting point and direction 
that text flows on a page.  There are three variations: left to right, right to 
left, and top to bottom.  Consider the inline progression of text is a vector, 
a line with a direction, the direction that our text flow is progressing.

This text flow vector has length that we can measure by the amount of 
characters the vector line contains.  If we measure the page the same character 
scale we can say how many characters fit on a page line, be 
it horizontal or vertical.

  .-----------------. 						.-----------------.
  |                |_\                      |               ||_\
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|                      |               |  | 
  |      \     /     |                      |               |  | 
  |       width      |                      |               |  | 	
  |                  |	left to right       |             / |  |  top to bottom	 
  |                  |		 or             |       height	|  |
  |                  |	right ot left       |             \ |  | 
  |                  |	 (reversed)         |               |  | 
  |                  |                      |               |  | 
  |                  |                      |               |  | 
  |                  |                      |               |  | 
  |                  |                      |               ∨  |
  '------------------'                      '------------------'

In the case of right to left & left to right inline progression determines 
width, and top to bottom progression determines height.
  
  
BLOCK PROGRESSION
-----------------
Block progression is another concept previously discussed, it determines where 
a new line starts when a line has reched the opposite side of the page, 
progressively stacking inline progression vectors.  We will this progession to 
be a vector too.  The direction of this type of vector will be in the direction 
of block progression.

 .-----------------. 							.----------------.
 |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|_\----                       || | | | | | | ||_\
 |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|  |                        || | | | | | | | || 
 |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|  |                        || | | | | | | | ||

 |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|  |	   left to right    || | | | | | | | || top to bottom
 |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>| height		or          || | | | | | | | ||

 |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|  ∨                        || | | | | | | | || 
 |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|----                       |∨ ∨ ∨ ∨ ∨ ∨ ∨ ∨ ∨|
 '------------------'                           '-----------------'
                                                |                 |
                                                |<~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
                                                '      width      ' 
  
This text flow vector has length that we can measure by how inline progression 
vectors are stacked on the page. Since each inline progression vector is a 
single character high for left to right & right ot left, or wide for top to 
bottom.  Measuring the page with the same character scale, we can determine 
how lines of text fit on a page.
 
So, text flows in a constant inline & block direction.  This flow naturally 
creates a block of text.  This block has a height and a width, which we choose 
to measure by how many characters wide and high the block is.

We know that height * width = area.  If we know how many characters wide and 
characters high we can determine how many characters can fit in a text block,   

	characters wide * characters high = characters in the text block.

It is important to begin to think of text as blocks, especially when are 
concerned with css.  Inline & block progession are concepts base to 
understanding html.


INTERRUPTING TEXT FLOW
----------------------
The English writing system, to choose one, allows for the interruption of text 
flow.  These interruptions are given purpose and used to convey meaning.


LINE BREAKS
'''''''''''
One type of interruption is called a line break.  If the inline progress ends 
before it reaches the opposite side of a page where it naturally ends.
 
  .-----------------. 
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|_\
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
  |~~~~~~~~>         | -- line break
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
  |                  |
  |                  |
  |                  |
  '------------------'
 
This is not the same as the space that may appear at the end of a word
due to English's word based line breaking, we consider this as space 
characters until the line's natural end.  One use of line breaking in English 
is the end of a paragraph.
 

INDENTATION
'''''''''''
Another form of interrupting natural text flow is indentation.  Indentation is 
starting a new line of text at a point further into its inling progress.  In 
English this point is typically four or eight characters into the inline flow.

With plain text indentation is accomplished by starting a new line with a space
character and adding typically a total of four or eight spaces before the first 
non-space character.  Another option is a tab character, wich is a space 
character that is typically four or eight characters wide.  A tab is a way of 
adding multiple spaces with one character. 

       .-----------------. 
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|_\
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
tab -- |    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
tab -- |    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
       '------------------'

Let's focus on what indentation really is, multiple consecutive spaces and 
ignore how it's used at a new line's starting point.  Multiple consecutive 
spaces may be conveyed with a tab characters or multiple space characters.



TEXT IN A BROWSER
=================

Below is a sample of plain text that we will examine first in a text editor and 
then in a web browser. What we find of interest is interruptions in the natural 
text flow.  The line number appears on the left to ease referencing 
interruptions, do not consider them part of the sample.

Here is a listing of all the interruptions.  Below the the sample we will discuss
the listing further.


	‘	Line breaks 	{single break : every line}
					  & {double break : 2, 12, 26, 31, 38, 48 & 53}

		TabSpaces		{1 tab : 50, 51, 52, 53}
					  & {5 tabs : 28, 29, 39, 31}

	Consecutive Spaces	{28 : 10 spaces}
						{29 : 12 spaces}
						{30 : 16 spaces}
					  & {31 : 14 spaces}’

Line breaks
-----------
A common practice of plain text documents is to set the inline progressive 
width to 80 characters,  In the sample a line break happens before reaching the 
80 characters.

For a bit of panache 2 consecutive line breaks appears after the title 
(line 1) and its underline (line 2).

The most common way to separate paragraphs in plain text is the use 2 
consecutive line breaks (lines 12, 26, 31, 38, 48 & 53).


Tab Spaces
----------
Lines 50 through 53 of the sample is an item list, which are commonly indented.  
A tab space is the first character on lines 50 through 53, to the left of the 
dash ( - ) character.

Lines 28 through 31 has another item list.  This list has 2 columns and each 
line is indented using 5 consecutive tabs.


Consecutive Spaces
------------------
The item list appearing on lines 28 through 31 uses consecutive spaces to 
separate the two columns.  Each line uses a different amount of spaces so that 
each of the right-hand column left aligns.  The number of consecutive spaces 
for each line is listed below.

	{28 : 10 spaces}
	{29 : 12 spaces}
	{30 : 16 spaces}
  & {31 : 14 spaces}



Here is how the text appears in a web browser.  Again, do not consider the line 
numbers on left part of the sample.

The browser replaces line breaks with a space
`````````````````````````````````````````````
The single line breaks used on every line appear to be ignored, the double 
spaces fair no better. Line breaks, single or consecutive, are replaced by a 
single space.

Let's focus on the stating segment of line 1:

	DOCUMENT TITLE ============== Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...

There should be a line break between 'TITLE' and '=============='.  In between 
'==============' and 'Lorem' there should be 2 line breaks.  In both cases 
there is now a single space.


The browser replaces tab spaces with a space
````````````````````````````````````````````
One of our item lists, appearing on lines 50 through 53, is now on line 17. The 
line breaks have been replaced with spaces so the 4 line list is now part of 1 
line.

	 - item 1 - item 2 - item 3 - item 4

What we are interested in is the tab space that no longer appear before each 
list item.  Like line breaks the browser replaces tab spaces with a single 
space.

Now let's examine the other list, the two column list, appearing on lines 28 
through 31, is now near the beginning of line 11, line breaks are now spaces.

	aliquam elit magna sagittis purus eget dolor sit In nec consectetur sit amet cursus sem ante
	
This list used 5 tab spaces prior to each before item in the left-hand column. 
There should be 5 tabs to the left of the following words:

	- aliquam 
	- purus
	- In
	- nit

Just as consecutive line breaks, consecutive tab spaces are replaced with a
single space.


The browser replaces consecutive spaces with a space
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The two column list, now on line 11, used consecutive spaces to separate the 
two columns and align the items of the right-hand column.  The browser displays 
only 1 space.  There should be spaces to the left of the following:

	- magna (10 spaces)
	- dolor (12 spaces)
	- consectetur (16 spaces)
	- cursus (14 spaces)


Browser width determines page width
```````````````````````````````````
The browser rendition does have some line breaks, otherwise there would only 
be one line of text and we would need to scroll the page to see all so it seems 
to recognize some end to inline progression, mimicking the opposite side of the 
inline progression starting point of a page (i.e. the right-hand edge of a 
page).

A the browser window mimicks the width of a page, therefore, the right edge of 
a browser window the right edge of a page.  If this isn't obvious, revisit our 
sample in a browser, adjust the width of the browser window and see the text 
adjust according to the new page width.


Strange Behavior
----------------
The behavior of text in a browser may seem peculiar, perhaps discouraging, but 
there are reasons why.  The main reason we will become clear when we discuss 
markup.


CHARACTER CODES
===============

The current html standard allows for 1,112,064 characters to be part of an html 
document.  A quick look at a keyboard should convince anyone that it's 
inadequate for typing all 1,112,064 characters.  Not of of the million plus 
characters are part of a particular writing system.  Some of the characters are 
universal across the all writing systems; arrows, or mathematical symbols for 
instance.

The html standard's million plus character set is established its incorporating 
the UTF-16 standard.  The UTF-16 standard was created by the Unicode 
Consortium. The UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) standard is,
over simplified,  a collection of 1,112,064 characters each assigned a unique 
number between 0 and 1,112,063.

Since each character has its own uniquely identifying number a web author has 
the option of adding a character in 2 ways; by typing the character, if 
possible, or by typing the unique character identifying number, which we will 
call a character code.



There is a third option for referencing a limited set of characters, reference 
by name.


To write


UTF Basic Latin
---------------


Illegal Characters
------------------
There are 3 characters where it is necessary to the character code instead of 
typing the character. The 3 characters are:

	< > &
The ampersand (&) should be obvious.  We use the amperand to escaping character 
codes.  So when a browser hits an ampersand while reading a page's content it 
will expect a character code.  In order to render an ampersand for example:

	 peanut butter & jelly

The necessity for character codes for other 2 characters, less than (<) and 
greater than (>), will become obvious very soon.  Less than and greater than 
are used for markup purposes.

	0 < 1 and 1 > 0

	0 &lt; 1 and 1 &gt; 0		0 &#60; 1 and 1 &#62; 0		0 &#x003C; 1 and 1 &#x003E; 0

Technically the greater than character is not an illeagal characters, so using 
the character code is optional.
