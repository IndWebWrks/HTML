Semantic Compositional Elements
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Up to this point in our study of html we have investigated the html elements 
that are the more general structural elements of composition; paragraphs, 
headings, list, and tables for example.  We've seen html primarily used to 
express the blocks that, put together, become a document, the structure of a 
particular web page.

We are now going investigate the html elements that are more situational.  
Instead of building the blocks of a document the html elements we are about to 
study are attempting to semantically represent situations where content is to 
be emphised, or is a quote, or an abbreviation.  These situational html 
elements are seeking to describe more nuanced than say a paragraph element.


Contact Information
===================
In formal documents authors often add conact information give readers a means 
for follow up questions or additional information.  A wide variety ways to 
communicate with any person; phone, email, social web sites, postal services, 
fax, the list seems to grow longer every day.  The <address> block type element 
represents a section of content that instructs readers the how establish 
communication.  The <address> element is not limited to communication with the 
author, although its most common usage.  A biographical article may include 
ways of contacting the subject of the article.

There really is no template to follow for using the <address> element. Consider 
the <address> element as a sectioning element, so having nested block type 
elements is common.  If the contact information is more of a list of multiple 
ways of communication should all be nested in one <address> element instead of 
an <address> element for each way listed.  Here are a few examples.


<address>
	<p>Way to contact your senator:</p>	
	<div>(555) 555-5555</div>
	<div>mysenator@senate.gov</div>
</address>


<address>
	<p>Send your order form to:</p>	
	<div>123 Main St.</div>
	<div>Big City, TX 12345</div>
</address>

Stress
======
In the content of a document its not uncommon to have it contain words that are 
of more importance, or may need to be stressed to clarify the meaning of a 
sentence.


The <em> Element
----------------
In speech a speaker can bend the meaning of a sentence by speaking louder, 
emphasizing, a particular word.  Let's choose a sentence to illustrate the 
point.  As you read the sentence have the voice in your head emphasize the 
the text nested in <em> elements.  Our sample sentence will be:

    She jumped in the river.

As simple sentence stating a simple fact.  Now let's emphasize different words 
and see if they bend the meaning our our sentence.

    <em>She</em> jumped in the river.

After reading this a sense accusation that she, not anyone else, jumped in the 
river.  Let's move our emphasis to a different word.

    She <em>jumped</em> in the river.

Now the sentence seems to clarify how she ended up in the river.  She wasn't 
pushed, she didn't fall, she jumped in to the river.  Let's try one more:

    She jumped in the <em>river</em>.

The question now seems to be clarifying what she jumped into.  It wasn't a lake 
or a swimming pool, she jumped into a river.

The <em> element provides an emphasizing voice to content.  The <em> element is 
an inline type element, that italicizes any nested text, and represents 
emphasized content.

Italicized fonts are used because the are more subtle than a boldface font.  
Expressing emphasis should be subtle, overuse loses it's subtle nature.  Not 
every sententce needs words emphasized.  Use the <em> element sparingly, as it 
is utilized it quickly loses it's purpose and becomes a disraction.

The <strong> Element
--------------------
In some circumstances, typically technical content, having the ability to scan 
a page and find important terms is important.  Boldfaced content is very 
noticable, especially if it's used sparingly.  The <strong> element represents 
terms or phrases intented to be noticed while scanning the page.  The <strong> 
element is an inline type that represent words of phrases of strong 
importantance.  The <strong> element will boldface any nested text.

Even more care of overuse is needed for the <strong> element than is needed for 
the <em> element.  Boldfaced text really standout, farmore than italicized 
text.  Use the <strong> element sparingly.

The <mark> Element
------------------
A newer way to html of stressing text in a document is the <mark> element.  A 
common practice of readers, using a marker, to highlight important phrases for
referencing in the future. The effect of highlighting is changing the 
background, behind the text to a bright color.  The <mark> element is an inline 
type that represents highlighted text.  Here is a general example:

    <p><mark>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</mark>. Nam 
	placerat metus a rhoncus vestibulum. Curabitur eget mi est. Curabitur mollis 
	justo vitae mi consequat, at scelerisque mi viverra. Vivamus euismod placerat 
	odio, ut  sollicitudin turpis pellentesque in. Suspendisse tempor volutpat 
	orci a pulvinar.</p>

Will be displayed by a browser as:

    <mark>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</mark>. Nam 
	placerat metus a rhoncus vestibulum. Curabitur eget mi est. Curabitur mollis 
	justo vitae mi consequat, at scelerisque mi viverra. Vivamus euismod placerat 
	odio, ut  sollicitudin turpis pellentesque in. Suspendisse tempor volutpat 
	orci a pulvinar.

Technical
=========
It should come to no suprise, due to the fact that html is a computer related, 
topic, that html provides the semantic means for expressing computer related 
content.  Computer related content tends to fall into one of three categories:  
the input from user interaction, the computer processes of an application 
typically expressed as computer code, and the output from an application to a
user.


Input
-----
The some of the ways a user interacts with an application are a keyboard, mouse, 
game control, touchscreen; the list grows as time advances.  In the early 
1990's there was really only one device, the keyboard; the mouse was becoming 
popular but no means the universal desktop device it has become.  The html 
element for expressing user input is the <kbd> element, an abbreviation for 
keyboard.  On the surface this may seem to limit the use of the <kbd> element 
only keyboard concerning content.  The <kbd> element was added to html very 
early on, as mentioned, when keyboards were really the only universal way for 
user input.  

Instead of adding new elements, such as <mouse>, for new types of user input, 
the html standand expanded the meaning of the <kbd> element to include any type 
of user input; be it mouse, touchscreen, etc.  That means use the <kbd> element 
to represent any type of user input, regardless that the element name is an 
abbreviation of keyboard.

Computer  Code -- <code>
--------------
A helpful way of explaining how an application processes user input and 
application output is to display the code that handles the processing; we've 
seen illustrations of code through out this text as html examples.  The 
<code> inline type element represents computer code.

The <pre> Element
-----------------
It becomes immediately obvious there is a major barrier to overcome when 
attempting to put code into a web page.  As a block of code grows from a single 
line to more, indentation and consecutive line breaks are commonly used for 
formatting code.  As we know, browsers treat indentation and consecutive line 
breaks as spaces.  Let's look at the following random segment of JavaScript:

    emptyNode(nodeType) {
        let objRef = {contentID:1, name:'blank document', tagName:nodeType};
        return this.toNode(objRef);
    },

    emptyNodeList(typeName) {
        let dd = document.createElement('dd');
        dd.dataset.type = typeName;
        return dd;
    },

We could, and remain semantically correct, utilize html the following way:

    <div><code>
	emptyNode(nodeType) {<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let objRef = {contentID:1, name:'blank document', tagName:nodeType};<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return this.toNode(objRef);<br/>
    },</code><br/>
	</div>

    <div><code>
	emptyNodeList(typeName) {<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let dd = document.createElement('dd');<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dd.dataset.type = typeName;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return dd;<br/>
    },</code><br/>
    </div>

This would not be pleasant to maintain.  This barrier created by how browser 
ignore indentation or consecutive spaces can be overcome with the <pre> 
element.
