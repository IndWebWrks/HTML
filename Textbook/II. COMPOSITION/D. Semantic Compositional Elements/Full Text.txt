Words and Letters Referred to as Words and Letters
Italicize words and letters that are referred to as words and letters. 

Shaw spelled Shakespeare without the final e.
The word _albatross_ probably derives from the Spanish and Portuguese word _alcatraz_.


Emphasis
Italics for emphasis ("Booth does concede, however ...") is a device that rapidly becomes 
ineffective. It is rarely appropriate in research writing.

Content Notes
In your notes, avoid lengthy discussions that divert the reader's atten- tion from the primary 
text. In general, comments that you cannot fit into the text should be omitted unless they 
provide essential justifica- tion or clarification of what you have written. You may use a 
note, for example, to give full publication facts for an original source for which you cite an 
indirect source and perhaps to explain why you worked from secondary material.

Brooks's "The Ballad of Chocolate Mabbie" is a poem about a series of proposed metonymic 
relations (Mabbie next to the grammar school gate, Mabbie next to Willie Boone) that 
concludes with the speaker's hopeful recognition that if Mabbie aligns herself with like 
figures (her "chocolate companions") she will achieve a positive sense of self-reliance 
("Mabbie on Mabbie to be").l

Note
1. In this paper, I follow the definition of _metonymy_ as a figure of
contiguity. For a good definition of the term, see Martin.
