Semantic Compositional Elements
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

	{{  Move <address> to this chapter }}

Up to this point in our study of html we have investigated the html elements 
that are the more general structural elements of composition; paragraphs, 
headings, list, and tables for example.  We've seen html primarily used to 
express the blocks that, put together, become a document, the structure of a 
particular web page.

We are now going investigate the html elements that are more situational.  
Instead of building the blocks of a document the html elements we are about to 
study are attempting to semantically represent situations where content is to 
be emphised, or is a quote, or an abbreviation.  These situational html 
elements are seeking to describe more nuanced than say a paragraph element.
